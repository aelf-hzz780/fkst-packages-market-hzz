# The full gate `scripts/run.sh test` is a COMPLETE, order-free AND-fold over
# mutually-independent verification units: ~40 repo-check python processes in
# cmd_check and one engine process per package in cmd_test. AND is commutative, so
# running the units concurrently changes only wall-clock, never which units run or
# their pass/fail set. These helpers own that concurrency (bounded to logical cores),
# a deterministic replay of each unit's output, and per-unit hermetic runtime/durable
# roots so parallel package runs never share engine state. Sourced into run.sh's shell
# so the units inherit its functions and (dynamic-scoped) locals.

# Parallel pool size = logical core count (a hardware fact read from the OS, not a
# magic constant). Falls back conservatively when the count cannot be read.

# Run one package's conformance + test(s) with its OWN ephemeral runtime/durable roots,
# so packages running in parallel never share engine runtime/durable state (the tests'
# real filesystem IO is FKST_RUNTIME_ROOT-relative). The collection dirs (report_dir,
# coverage_report_dir), the roots_parent, and the failure filter are EXPLICIT arguments
# (the contract is in the signature, not a comment); the per-package roots are created
# UNDER roots_parent, which cmd_test registers in its EXIT trap so they are swept even if
# a unit subshell is killed. `--report-json`/`--coverage` land in the shared $name-keyed
# collection dirs for the post-join ratchet/G5 fan-in. Mirrors the former serial loop
# body exactly; returns 0 on success, 1 on any failure. `verbose` and the run_quiet_*/
# load_composed_test_roots functions and BIN are legitimately module-ambient.
#
# CONTRACT: unit commands (this and the cmd_check checks) must always `return`, never
# `exit` — an `exit` terminates the pool's capturing subshell before it records the exit
# code, which run_units_parallel then fail-closes as a failure. run_one_package must be
# invoked only via run_units_parallel (its FKST_RUNTIME_ROOT export relies on the subshell).
