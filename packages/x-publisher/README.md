# x-publisher

General X release package - **contract + shadow-first live implementation.** A reusable publish lane
for X that any host repo composes via `pkg.queue`: consume a safe publish request, validate that only
small control fields plus source pointers are present, and emit a receipt.

- **consumes** `x_publish_request` - `{ artifact_id, source_ref, content_ref?, platform?, channel?,
  dedup_key?, trace_id?, approval_id?, scheduled_at?, metadata? }`.
- **produces** `x_published` - preview receipts in shadow mode, blocked receipts when a requested
  live write is not authorized, and published receipts after NyxID returns an X tweet id.
- **payload boundary** body/content fields (`tweet`, `body`, `text`, `message`, `media_bytes`,
  provider raw responses) and sensitive fields (`token`, `bearer`, `oauth`, `secret`,
  `credential`, authorization-like names) are rejected fail-closed.
- **posture** shadow-first: live writes require all of `channel = "live"`,
  `FKST_X_PUBLISH_WRITE=1`, and `FKST_NYXID_X_SERVICE_SLUG=<service-slug>`.

## Live X write contract

`x-publisher` uses NyxID as the only credential path. It never accepts or stores raw X tokens.

Required host env for live mode:

```sh
FKST_X_PUBLISH_WRITE=1
FKST_NYXID_X_SERVICE_SLUG=api-twitter-2-media
FKST_X_PUBLISH_EXPECTED_USERNAME=hzz780
```

When `FKST_X_PUBLISH_EXPECTED_USERNAME` is set, the package first calls:

```text
nyxid proxy request <slug> /users/me?user.fields=id,name,username -m GET
```

The returned username must match before the package can post to:

```text
nyxid proxy request <slug> /tweets -m POST -d {"text":"..."}
```

The `/tweets` path is relative to the NyxID service base URL `https://api.x.com/2`; do not use
`/2/tweets`.

## Content resolution

The publish payload stays pointer-only. For GitHub issue driven workflows, `content_ref` points to
the weekly content issue, typically `#42` relative to the schedule issue repo. The weekly content
issue must contain one explicit tweet text field, for example:

````md
type: weekly-content
project: chronoai
week: 2026-W31

tweet-text:
```
FKST live publish verification for hzz780 via NyxID. Test post.
```
````

MVP live publishing supports one text-only X post up to 280 characters. Media upload and thread
publication are intentionally separate follow-up capabilities.

Invalid requests are skipped with a greppable log and never masquerade as successful publishes.
`core.preview_receipt(payload, "skipped")` exists as a safe shape helper for hosts/tests that need
an explicit skipped receipt, but the department does not raise it for invalid requests.
